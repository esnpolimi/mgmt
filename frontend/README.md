# Getting Started with Vite

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It optimizes the build for the best performance, ensuring fast loading and modern JavaScript output.

### `npm run preview`

Previews the production build locally.\
This is useful for ensuring the build works before deployment.

## Learn More

To learn more about Vite, check out the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## Why Vite?

- **Faster Development**: Vite uses a lightning-fast dev server powered by native ES modules.
- **Optimized Build**: It produces highly optimized and smaller builds compared to traditional bundlers like Webpack.
- **Modern Tooling**: Out-of-the-box support for TypeScript, JSX, and other modern web technologies.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Changes reflected instantly without refreshing the browser.

## Deployment

You can deploy the production build (`dist` folder) to your preferred hosting service. For static hosting, services like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are great options.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, make sure:

1. All dependencies are properly installed by running `npm install`.
2. You are using the correct Node.js version (check the Vite documentation for details).
3. Check the [Vite FAQ](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#faq) for any common issues.

Happy coding!
